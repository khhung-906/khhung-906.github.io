    paper_link: ""
    code_link: "https://github.com/pd-perry/TQL"
    page_link: "https://pd-perry.github.io/transformer-q-learning/"
    abstract: "Transformer-based Q-learning scales poorly due to attention collapse. We propose TQL, which prevents collapse through proper scaling and architecture choices, enabling effective Q-functions in both offline and online RL."

    code_link: ""
    page_link: "https://cmlab-victor.github.io/cmlab-vicotor.github.io/"
    abstract: "Existing VIC reward models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to lack of sub-stage awareness. We propose VICtoR, a hierarchical reward model that leverages LLM for task decomposition and VLM for progress assessment, achieving 43% improvement in long-horizon manipulation."

  #   code_link: ""
  #   page_link: ""
  #   abstract: "Finding routes is essential for map services, yet most methods overlook user-specific preferences. We introduce a novel approach that uses historical route data to filter irrelevant paths and incorporates query semantics, like "route from Seattle to Redmond with fewer traffic lights," for optimized, preference-aware routing."
