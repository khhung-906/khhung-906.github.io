        "abstract": "LLMs excel across domains but remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious prompts redirect attention from original instructions. We introduce Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that monitors attention patterns to identify such attacks without requiring additional LLM inference."

        "abstract": "Finding routes is essential for map services, yet most methods overlook user-specific preferences. We introduce a novel approach that uses historical route data to filter irrelevant paths and incorporates query semantics, like “route from Seattle to Redmond with fewer traffic lights,” for optimized, preference-aware routing."
